1. Drug traits.
The BEA 2180 BR Respimat® liquid aerosol inhaler consists of a BEA 2180 BR solution and a Respimat® inhaler filled into the reservoir.
A reservoir is provided for each inhaler.
The Respimat®® system is a handheld, pocket oral inhalation delivery system.
The drug delivery system utilizes mechanical energy to eject the drug solution in the metering container at a low velocity in the form of an aerosol ("light fog").
A wide range of BEA 2180 BR Respimat® inhalers and a placebo formulation have been developed for use in the research phase of clinical trials.
Consistent with the international standard for the declaration of active substances, the specification referred to herein refers to the cation, ie BEA 2180, which is also an effective part of the molecule.
2. The ingredients of the drug.
2.1 BEA 2180 BR RESPIMAT® Liquid Aerosol Inhaler.
The BEA 2180 BR Respimat®® formulation is an aqueous solution containing the active ingredient BEA 2180 BR.
The composition of the BEA 2180 BR Respimat®® in 50, 100 and 200 μg sizes and the composition of the placebo are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1: Composition (weight/dose) of BEA 2180 BR Respimat® liquid aerosol inhaler.
A 1 g of BEA 2180 is equivalent to 1.211 g of BEA 2180 BR;
b shows the mass of anhydrous benzalkonium chloride.
c Benzalkonium chloride may be used in its 50% aqueous solution or its solids; however, it must be in accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia's monograph on "benzalkonium chloride solution" and "benzalkonium chloride".
d Single dose refers to the amount applied twice by pressing the inhalation device.
e In addition to the absence of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the formulation of the placebo used in clinical trials is the same as that of the active drug.
f Can be replaced with pure water.
