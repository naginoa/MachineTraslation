
BEA 2180 BR filled into a cartridge, and a Respimat  inhalation device. One cartridge is
used per device.

Respimat  is a hand held, pocket sized oral inhalation device that uses mechanical energy
to generate a slow moving aerosol cloud of medication (“soft mist”) from a metered
volume of drug solution.

Three dose strengths of BEA 2180 BR Respimat  solution for inhalation, corresponding to
50, 100 and 200 µg and a placebo formulation will be used. One dose will be administered
by 2 actuations of the inhalation device. In order to conform to international standards for
declaration of active substances, the dose strengths refer to the cation, i.e. BEA 2180, as
the active moiety of the molecule.
